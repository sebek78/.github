# About me

I'm Front End Developer with about two years of experience. I work mostly in internal web application maintenance.

## My skills used at work:

- AngularJS (1st, the legacy version)
- React with Redux, Saga, and Reselect
- Ruby with Sinatra framework (rarely)
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS + Sass
- Others: Git, Webpack, ESLint, Linux

## My skills used at home:

- React, Typescript
- Nestj.js (backend framework based on Node.js)

## My self-improvement goals in 2021-2022:

- improve my React skills
- work as much as possible with Typescript
- learn server-side programming with Nest.js
- learn Nx, Storybook, Jest
