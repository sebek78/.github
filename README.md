# About me

I'm Front End Developer with about three years of experience. I work mostly in internal web application maintenance.

## My skills used at work:

- AngularJS (1st, the legacy version)
- React with Redux+Saga or React Query
- Ruby with Sinatra framework (rarely)
- JavaScript, HTML, CSS + Sass

## My other skills used after hours:

- Typescript
- MUI (component library)
- Nest.js (backend framework based on Node.js)
- Prisma (Typescript ORM)

## My self-improvement goals in 2023:

- work only with Typescript
- improve my React skills
- learn server-side programming with Nest.js
- learn Storybook, Jest
- learn Rust
